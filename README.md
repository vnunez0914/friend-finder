# Pokemon Friend Finder

This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the friend with the best overall match. In this case the friends are Pokemon. 


# How to use Friend Finder

1. The user will fill out a survey of 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. The app will match the user with a Pokemon friend based off there score

2. This app uses Express to handle routing and is hosted by Heroku. Below are links to install the npm package express and if you wish to deploy to Heroku a link to the site is provided.
